## Caveats

Some of the genera listed in Salter et al. **should not** be excluded bluntly at the genus level, because they include some species which are actually Human-associated.
It is not enough to just consider the genus level for those, and exclude them: they warrant more careful inspection.
For those genera, a separate list has been provided in this folder.
